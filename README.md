### How to Run ###
To start off, the user will enter their unique username, and once they start, they'll get the choice of adding game information from either Warzone, Apex Legends, or Fortnite. Once they select this, they'll be given the option of either adding information from a specific match or going to what information is already present. If the user chooses to add information, then they'll have to include the damage, kills and placement of this said match. From there they can either add information from more matches or go straight to the statistics. Once their in the statistics, they can view their unique statistics and display the statistics of other unique players.
